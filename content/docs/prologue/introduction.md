## Get started

Githaxs provides two different GitHub Applications: Githaxs Meta and Githaxs.

The [Githaxs Meta](https://github.com/apps/githaxs-meta) application **does not** have access to your application source code. It performs checks on and tasks based on Meta data (i.e. checking Pull Request Title, size of PR, etc).

The Githaxs applicatios **does** have access to your application source code. It performs tasks such as linting, static scanning, and running unit tests.
