## How do I Migrate?

Migrating to Githaxs is **a lot** easier than migrating between other CI/CD providers. When migrating to Githaxs there is no need to translate between Jenkins and CircleCI syntax or to contact us for a migration plan. 


Migration is a three-step process:

1. Install Githaxs Application.

2. Delete CI tasks from your current CI tooling.

3. Configure Githaxs tasks.
